Daily Greens
============

Grow your own greens automatically in a pretty looking unit
integrated in your kitchen!

We're using ebb and flood hydroponics and can control any

Daily Greens has a reservoir for nutritious water that lasts
for several months and sends you reminders when to fill it,
well before actually running out.
